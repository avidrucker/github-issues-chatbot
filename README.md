# Github Issues Chatbot

This is a prototype "minimum lovable product" component of a larger project relating to GitGuppy, a collection of tools and content desiged to help people new to Open Source contribute more easily and joyfully.

This chatbot focuses first and foremost on greeting newcomers to a GitHub repository. Future chatbots will likely help with issue labeling, answering basic questions about projects, and even helping to convert code TODO's into GitHub issues. Simple and easy installability of this chatbot as a GitHub Action is a future goal of this project.
